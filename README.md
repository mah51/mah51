### Hi there, I'm [Michael!](https://michael-hall.me) 👋

Hi, I'm a uni student learning to code...

Previous projects:
-  [ScuffedMDB](https://github.com/mah51/scuffedmdb) - movie rating website, a superior replacement to the old movie-web! 
-  [ScuffedMDB Bot](https://github.com/mah51/scuffedmdb-bot)! A bot that provides a nice integration with a discord server for the ScuffedMDB website
-  My personal website - [michael-hall.me](https://github.com/mah51/michael-hall.me), to show off some of my projects and maybe start a blog.
-  Ask me about anything [here](https://github.com/mah51/mah51/issues)
- The Discord bot: MikeBot - Not hosted currently due to expense.
- A react [website](https://github.com/mah51/WormTracker) dedicated to counting grid squares with worm tracks. (pretty niche 🧐 )
